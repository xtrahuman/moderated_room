# moderated_room
fullstack building of moderated room. In this project, users become administrators immediately upon creating a room. Other users cannot view the hidden content of a group unless they become members of the group. Users can request to join a room, but only the moderator or administrator can accept the user into the group. A user can belong to several rooms, so the user's role is connected to room membership.
